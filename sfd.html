    <h3>Abstraction build over asynchronous messagesâ€¦. </h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li> Yes, you can repeat this but it is not very useful.
            <li> You put your APIs (functions, calls to web services, basic building blocks of logic,etc) in nodes and
          you compose all these in a special language that get executed by jumping (swarming) from node to node.
          <h5>Still.. nothing?</h5>
        </ol>
    </p>

      <h3>What is a "swarm" ? </h3>
      <p>
          <img src="images/swarm/swarm.png" />
      <ol>
          <li> It is a message
          <li> It is better because the swarm is "swarming" . Obviously.
      </ol>
      </p>


      <h3>Bees are swarming from their hive in a forest, what the heck can be similar for messages? </h3>
      <p>
      <ol>
          <li> When sending a message,we can pretend that the process (the one that is sending that message) is like a hive in a tree? Right? And the message
              will arrive in another process (node), another tree, isn't it?
          <li> But.. to do something meaningful, you don't send only a message, sometimes a lot of messages are sent between many processes.
          You can unifying all that confusing behaviour as a swarming process where the initial swarm (message) is moving from tree to tree (processes) and
          eventually the swarm get divided and is joining again when searching for food or for a new home.
      </ol>
          <img src="images/swarm/forest.jpg" />
      </p>


          <h3>Do the swarm have a plan?</h3>
          <p>
          <ol>
              <li> I can't read bees mind, but we can imagine that any swarming happens to follow some PHASES
              <li> Message swarming have a "swarming description", a file where what will happen with a new swarm is carefully
          planned. <br> <h5> A swarming description contains variables (the bees :) ) , ctors (constructors, initialisation
              phase) and descriptions for all phases. </h5>
          </ol>
          </p>

          <h3>Dude,where is the honey?</h3>
          <p>
          <ol>
              <li> It is in hives, of course.
              <li> Well, for SwarmESB based systems, the honey is carried by bees (variables) but can be also stored and collected from
          trees (nodes,process) visited by swarms. <br>
          <h5>  The nodes (trees) offer to swarms some honey as APIs </h5>
          </ol>
            <img src="images/swarm/honey.jpg" />
          </p>

      <h3>Why is called swarming?</h3>
      <p>
      <ol>
          <li> Because we like organic metaphors
          <li> Because jumping  from node to node  (using the network) of a set of values can be seen as sending messages
          but can be also seen as a swarming of some mysterious bees that care the honey (values) . After a swarm reaches
          a node, it can swarm again and again and you can describe and understand all the related swarming activities.
          <br> <h5> What can be cooler than this?</h5>
      </ol>
      </p>


      <h3>Ok,I got it, show me some code </h3>
      <p>
      <ol>
          <li> <a href="https://github.com/salboaie/SwarmESB/">Check SwarmESB's examples and code </a>
          <li> <h5><a href="https://github.com/salboaie/SwarmESB/wiki"> Wiki, wiki we are swarming... (Read our wiki)</a> </h5>
      </ol>
      </p>


      <h3>It is not somehow similar to SOA?</h3>
      <p>
      <ol>
          <li> Yes it is.  It is trying to solve similar concerns and actually it can work well in a SOA environment.
          <li> SOA requires some sort of ESBs and with SwarmESB we are targeting the orchestration and loose coupling issues that ESBs are trying to address.
      </ol>
